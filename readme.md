## This is my first ever project created with Tailwind CSS, in this Project i cloned the Paytm website, using tailwind css and also used navbar component from DaisyUi component library, while creating this project i feel much more comfortable using Tailwind CSS and learned following:

- Installation of tailwind using tailwind cli
- Configuring tailwind.config.js
- Installing Plugin such as DaisyUi
- Tailwind Classes
- Tailwind Components
- Responsive Design
- CSS
